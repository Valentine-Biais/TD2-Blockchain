Our code starts by a menu with three options:
  1. BIP39
  2. BIP32
  3. Exit
 
 You can write "BIP39", "BIP32" to execute them or press any key to exit.
 
 For BIP39 and BIP32:
 When you have to enter a 12 words seed, the program checks if the seed is correct.
 Indeed, it counts the number of words which should be equal to 12.
 Then, it looks if all the words are in the dictionnary.
